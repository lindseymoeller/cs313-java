        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>HappE-mail is reinventing the way you send email. No longer do you 
            have to log in to an email client to send a simple email, and t's simple
            to use, just enter the destination email address, a subject, and
        the message and you are one your way!</p>

        <h2>Information</h2>
           <p>For this Java project, I used the Google Gmail API to create an 
           application that would send emails. All the application needs is 
           user input for the recipient's email address, the subject of the 
           message, and the body/text of the message. 
           Click <a href="login.jsp">here</a> to view the app.</p>
           
           <p>Disclaimer: This application is not working as expected. The emails
           are not being sent as they should.</p>
